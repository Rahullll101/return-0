### Every Model is running locally (Offline / Without Internet)

## ABSTRACT:
With a particular eye toward the varied linguistic terrain of the Indian subcontinent, our AI model aims to advance natural language processing for Indian languages. Our model uses the GPT architecture with algorithms like STABLE DIFFUSION AND TRANSFORMER Modules to enable smooth and culturally sensitive discussions in a variety of languages, including Kannada, Hindi, Marathi and more. Also the importance of our project is that it works in OFFLINE mode so that weaker section of our country can also use this model, The chatbot improves user engagement and comprehension by taking into account language specifics, geographical variances, and informal idioms that are unique to India. By making sophisticated language models available to a larger audience, our effort not only helps to democratize AI but also promotes and preserves India's rich linguisticÂ legacy.

#### The Steps to run this model locally is explain in the respective models `README.md` file!!!
